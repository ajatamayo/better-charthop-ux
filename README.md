# Charthop Better UX

I wasn't too happy with Charthop's UX! So I made a **Chrome Extension** that modifies its UI.

## How to Install

1. Download the [latest zip file](/../../releases/latest/download/archive.zip) from the releases page to a good location (i.e. documents)
2. Extract the zip file into a folder
3. In Chrome, go to `chrome://extensions` (type it in the browser)
4. Turn on developer mode at the upper right corner
5. Click Load Unpacked, then load the folder from Step 2
6. Check it out on Charthop on the following pages:
   - Manager Evaluations popup
   - Performance Evaluation
   - Addendum Perf Evals

## Screenshots and Changes

### Manager Evals Popup

1. The popup now takes the whole screen.
2. Your report's icon is displayed on the upper left corner to show who you're evaluating.
3. The form is arranged into more sensible groups, not just one column.

### Self Evals, Colleague Evals Results

![Self Evals, Colleague Evals Results](/screenshots/self-colleague-evals.png)

1. Removed empty containers.
2. Arranged into a 2-column grid.
3. Images can be clicked to zoom, but know that if it's a low res image, it'll just be pixelated.
4. Fixed pre element breaking the grid.
5. Grouped each Q&A into a card for better readability.
